CONTENTS

This library contains functions and structures that can help
constructing a single-threaded UDP server with DTLS support in
C99. The following components are available:

* dtls
  Basic support for DTLS with pre-shared key mode.

* tests
  The subdirectory tests contains test programs that show how each
  component is used.

BUILDING

When using the code from the git repository, invoke make to build DTLS as a
shared library.



//Changes to makefile

We need to make changes in /test/makefile as follows to use PSK: 

	CFLAGS  := -DLOG_LEVEL_DTLS=$(LOG_LEVEL_DTLS) -I. -I.. -I../$(DTLS_SUPPORT) 
	CFLAGS  := -DLOG_LEVEL_DTLS=$(LOG_LEVEL_DTLS) -I. -I.. -I../$(DTLS_SUPPORT) -i DTLS_PSK


//Compilation(akefiless) :
Goto mainfolder Execute : $ make
Go to tests and execute : $ make


//Running :

	On server run command:-
		
	$ ./dtls-server 

	On client run command:-
		
	$ ./dtls-client 0.0.0.0
	$ ./dtls-client Server-IP

/**********************************TESTING Purposes*****************/

//On server run command:-
		
	$ ./dtls-server 

//On client run command:-
		
	$ sh runtestclient.sh
	$ bash readtestfiles.sh
